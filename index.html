            <p class="text">My name is Anthony Richard Spyker, shorthed to Anthony R. Spyker.  I am an adult human male who currently resides in Grand Rapids, Michigan.   I was born in Muskegon, Michigan on October 7th, 1985 at 10:05 AM.  I grew up just south in Grand Haven, Michigan with my mother, father and sister.  
              After graduating High School in 2004 I went on to gain an associate degree in liberal arts.  I went on to attend Grand Valley State university for a year working toward a bachelor’s in political science and philosophy.  During the course of my early 20’s I traveled around the pacific north west and central continental united states attending concerts and enjoying a simple laissez-faire lifestyle before I returned to west Michigan and began a 6-year stint at Founders brewing co.  There I did everything front of house, from bussing and food running all the way up to bartending and managing. During that 6 years at Founders brewing co. I attended Grand Rapids Community College where I received a Lab technician associates.  I followed that time with a cumulative 2 more years at Grand Valley State University where I completed a bachelor’s in science and Mathematics with an emphasis on Chemistry and pure mathematics.  I performed research under the tutelage of Dr. John Bender and presented some work in front of esteemed Chemistry community at the 2017 American Chemical Society conference in San Francisco.  After college I continued working as a professional tutor at Grand Rapids Community College and an adjunct professor for chemistry at Grand Valley State University.  All The while working random bartending jobs at Eastern Kille Distillery and The Sovengaurd, both located in Grand Rapids, MI.  In April of 2021 I will have completed a Coding bootcamp certification through Michigan State University and will be amply ready to begin coding in a professional arena.
